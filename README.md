Basic bed front lights for Vorons. Initially developed for a Printer for Ants Double Dragon mod that combined the tri-belted bed from a Hex Zero.

There's both a "normal" NeoPixel WS2812 and a Barf version. The only difference is the holder for the LED pcb.

It uses the standard StealhBurner clear LED diffusor.
