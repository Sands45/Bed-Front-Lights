Basic bed front lights for Vorons. Initially developed for a Printer for Ants Double Dragon mod that combined the tri-belted bed from a Hex Zero.

This will work on any printer with a 1515 or 2020 front beam under the bed.

There's both a "normal" NeoPixel WS2812 and a Barf version. The only difference is the holder for the LED pcb.

Small chanel to route wires for a 2020 extrusion. Can put that up or down. 

It uses the standard StealhBurner clear LED diffusor.
